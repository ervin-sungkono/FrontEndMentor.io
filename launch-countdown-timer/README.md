Countdown timer single page, the timer will start from a fixed amount of time and then keep going down until it reaches 0. Evey time a number displaed is changing, the card will show a flip animation similar to a calendar being flipped.

### The challenge

- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 14 days)
- **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle
