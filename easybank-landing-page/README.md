## My process
I started the process by analyzing the design, comparing how it looks like on desktop and mobile and then figuring out how the transition from desktop to mobile would look like.

After the analyzing process, I started by breaking down the page into smaller components. Then, I developed components for each section, starting from the navigation bar and all the way down to the footer.

### Built with
